<h1><h2> Hi everyone, I would like to share my experience when I was working as a kindergarden teacher. On 2018 I was done my (SPM) which is  Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia or called as (Malaysian Certificate of Education) while waiting for my result I was worked as kindergarden teacher at LITTLE CALIPHS BANDAR TASIK PUTERI. I learned a lot not only about in terms of teaching and learning but also how to take care of young children from various aspects. For me being a teacher was not as easy as what people think. Although circumstances are sometimes challenging and prevent us from being good but I still strive to be a good teacher in educating.As we know the career as a teacher is a lot, but sometimes when I look at the behavior of children I feel like I lost stress for a while. End of 2019 my SPM result came out I am very sad not because my results were not excellent but because I had to leave my students because I accepted an offer to study at UiTM Kedah and want to continue my studies but I am also very happy because I can feel the experience of educating Kindergarten children as long as I work there. That was my shorted experience as a workers I hope one day I can be a teacher again.<h1> <h2>
